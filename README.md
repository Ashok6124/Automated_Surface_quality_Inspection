# Automated_Surface_quality_Inspection
This dataset was downloaded from NEU Metal Surface Defects Databse which contains six kinds of typical surface defects of the hot-rolled steel strip are collected, i.e., rolled-in scale (RS), patches (Pa), crazing (Cr), pitted surface (PS), inclusion (In) and scratches (Sc). The database includes 1,800 grayscale images: 300 samples each of six different kinds of typical surface defects.

But for this analysis, the dataset divided into 3 directories. The training directory contains 276 images of each class from the 300 images. The rest 24 images of each class also divided into tests and valid datasets.
